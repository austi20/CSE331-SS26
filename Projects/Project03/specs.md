# Project 3: Hash Tables

**Due: Monday, March 9th @ 11:59 PM ET**

_This is an individual project. Do not copy or share your work._

## Assignment Overview

Hash tables are a powerful data structure known for their ability to perform insertion, deletion, and lookup operations with an expected runtime of **O(1)**. This makes them highly efficient for storing and retrieving data quickly.

```python
>>> print(fruit_colors["banana"])
yellow
```

In this project, you will implement a **hash table** from scratch in Python and apply it to solve application problems.

## Assignment Notes

1. **Prohibited Operations:** Using any of the following will result in **0 points**:
   - A Python dictionary (`dict`).
   - Any built-in container or collection other than a **basic list, tuple, or set**.
   - The `nonlocal` keyword.

2. **Improper Use of Magic or Protected Methods:**  
   - Please don't call a magic method such as `__len__()` directly with `table.__len__()` instead of using the correct syntax `len(table)`.
   - Please don't call a protected method like `_insert()` outside of its implementing class (use `__setitem__()` instead).
   Refer to the section below for details on magic and protected methods.

3. **Magic Methods:**  
   - Magic methods are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores, such as `__len__()`.
   - In this project, magic methods serve primarily as wrappers that call protected methods.
   - These methods should be brief, typically no more than a few lines of code.
   - Refer to the syntax table below to understand the relationship between magic and protected methods.

4. **Protected Methods:**  
   - Protected methods begin with a single underscore, such as `_insert()`, to indicate they are intended for internal use.
   - Unlike in languages like C++, Python does not strictly enforce method privacy.
   - Consider magic methods as the **interface** and protected methods as the **implementation**.
   - Refer to the syntax table below for guidance on their usage.

5. **Proper Work Distribution Between Magic and Protected Methods:**  
   - Most testing will be conducted on the magic methods `__setitem__()`, `__getitem__()`, and `__delitem__()`, simulating real-world use.
   - These magic methods should delegate core functionality to `_insert()`, `_get()`, and `_delete()`, respectively.
   - Ensure your work is properly divided by testing `_insert()`, `_get()`, and `_delete()` separately before integrating them into the magic methods.

6. **Hash Function Considerations:**  
   - `_hash_1` and `_hash_2` depend on the string's size.
   - For this project, assume they run in **O(1) (constant) time**.

7. **Project Constraints:**  
   - The **maximum capacity** will not exceed **1,000**.
   - **All keys** will be of type **string**.

8. **Space Complexity Considerations:**  
   - Hash tables inherently allocate **O(N)** space.
   - Python dictionaries are optimized for space efficiency, but this project requires load factor constraints that may increase space usage.
   - While overall space usage is **O(N)**, focus on **minimizing auxiliary (extra) memory usage**.
   - Aim to keep auxiliary space usage within **O(N)**.

### Syntax Table: Magic vs. Protected Methods

| Protected Method             | Magic Method                     | How to Use Magic Methods  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
|                              | `__len__(self)`                  | `len(self)`               |
| `_insert(self, key, value)`  | `__setitem__(self, key, value)`  | `self[key] = value`       |
| `_get(self, key)`            | `__getitem__(self, key)`         | `self[key]`               |
| `_delete(self, key)`         | `__delitem__(self, key)`         | `del self[key]`           |
|                              | `__contains__(self, key)`        | `key in self`             |

## Application: Image Duplicates

![dupes.JPG](https://i.imgur.com/1WIo7md.jpg)

**Important: The use of `sort()` or any sorting method is prohibited for this problem. Otherwise, you will receive a 0 on the application problem.**

Congratulations! You have just been hired full-time as an application developer consultant for Dream Company LLC! For your first task, the client has requested that you create an app that detects and displays information about duplicate images in a folder. The goal of this app is:

- To tell users which images they should keep (the earliest image in the set of duplicates).
- To inform users which images are duplicates of the images they should keep, i.e., the ones they should delete.

You smile to yourself since you know that your trusty `HashTable` is perfect for detecting duplicates. Like many objects, images can be hashed (explained below), so you only need to populate a `HashTable` and check if the image is already present to detect a duplicate. However, there is an added twist: **Rotated versions of images (rotated by 90-degree increments) also count as duplicates!** This certainly complicates things. Luckily, your coworker has already done much of the groundwork for you.

They have used Python's [imagehash](https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/) library, among other tools, to generate the following data from each image for you to use:

1. A set of four unique string hashes produced when the image is rotated 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees. **Rotated versions of images will share hashes but in a different (shifted right) order!**
2. The corresponding filename of the image to which these hashes belong.

Your job is to take this data and output information about the duplicates into a `HashTable`.

The **keys** of this `HashTable` should be the filenames of the first (when iterating over the input lists) appearances of unique images.

The **values** of these keys should be the list of filenames of any duplicates (including rotated versions) in the order they appeared.

### Examples

_Note that we have included an `Images` folder, which contains subfolders corresponding to each test case by number. Use them however you like._

#### Example 1

Here is what the folder looks like:
![dupes2.PNG](https://i.imgur.com/zUJstzm.png)

And here is the test case:

There are no duplicates, so the value lists are empty, meaning we should keep all images. Notice how the hashes in the two lists in `data` differ completely.

```python
data = [['b0c71acc47b33a3c', 'd4a6875833a46eb3', 'e56d4e6612196b96', '810dd2f26e0f3b39'],
        ['cc4e23b330b32773', '943e2de2c03f33cc', '99e67639651a5299', 'c1947948d5976766']]
filenames = ['c02.jpg', 'd01.jpg']
expected = [('c02.jpg', []), ('d01.jpg', [])]  # HashTable should look like {'c02.jpg': [], 'd01.jpg': []}
actual = sorted(display_duplicates(data, filenames).items())
self.assertEqual(expected, actual)  # should pass
```

#### Example 2

Here is what the folder looks like:
![dupes3.PNG](https://i.imgur.com/qX09oYs.png)

And here is the test case:

Rotated versions count as duplicates! Notice how the hashes in the two lists are identical, but the second list is the first list shifted right by 2.

```python
data = [['e7d7c78889189b07', 'ba1f80bb1e1e6155', 'b0fc9222dcb2dcac', 'af95d4104bb434be'],
        ['b0fc9222dcb2dcac', 'af95d4104bb434be', 'e7d7c78889189b07', 'ba1f80bb1e1e6155']]
filenames = ['d04_0.jpg', 'd04_180.jpg']
expected = [('d04_0.jpg', ['d04_180.jpg'])]  # HashTable should look like {'d04_0.jpg': ['d04_180.jpg']}
actual = sorted(display_duplicates(data, filenames).items())
self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
```

#### Example 3

Here is what the folder looks like:
![dupes4.PNG](https://i.imgur.com/YMlnVWW.png)

And here is the test case:

Multiple duplicates appear as additional elements in the value list for the appropriate key, in the order they appeared in the `filenames`/`data` lists.

```python
data = [['9705695a7a587d58', '80c93a703f3f981f', 'c2af34e02ff229b2', 'd562634a4a95cdb5'],
        ['c2af34e02ff229b2', 'd562634a4a95cdb5', '9705695a7a587d58', '80c93a703f3f981f'],
        ['94ef11d91f0f07e0', 'd1ae43475e317e81', 'c16546734aa57a6b', '842656ed0b9b3b2b'],
        ['c16546734aa57a6b', '842656ed0b9b3b2b', '94ef11d91f0f07e0', 'd1ae43475e317e81']]
filenames = ['c04_0.jpg', 'c04_180.jpg', 'd02_0.jpg', 'd02_0_180.jpg']
expected = [('c04_0.jpg', ['c04_180.jpg']),
            ('d02_0.jpg', ['d02_0_180.jpg'])]
actual = sorted(display_duplicates(data, filenames).items())
self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
```

### **Function Description**

- **`display_duplicates(data: List[List[str]], filenames: List[str]) -> HashTable`**
  - Outputs duplicate images in a `HashTable` in the format `{key: value}`, where:
    - **Keys** are the filenames of the images to keep (i.e., the earliest occurrences of unique images in `filenames`).
    - **Values** are lists of duplicate filenames (including rotated versions), in the order they appeared.
  - If an image has no duplicates, its value list should be empty.
  - Each filename appears exactly once, either as a key or as a value, but never both.
  - _Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of images (`N = len(data) = len(filenames)`)._
  - **Parameters:**
    - `data: List[List[str]]` — A list of lists of four hash strings, corresponding to the hash results for each image rotated 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.
    - `filenames: List[str]` — A list of corresponding filenames.
  - **Returns:** A `HashTable` containing image duplicate information as described above.


After finishing the `display_duplicates` function, you are contacted by Big Hit Music (the label that owns BTS!). They are impressed with your HashTable skills and would now like to commission you to develop an algorithm that helps them generate new fan chants for the ARMY (BTS fan group name).

<img src="img/jungkook_bts.png" alt="Jungkook BTS" width="400" height="350">
<img src="img/qrE1B_5f.jpg" alt="RM BTS" width="300" height="350">

This algorithm will take a string representing a possible fan chant. Additionally, this function will take a list of strings representing the words we want to find within the fan chant. For example, the fan chant string could be `"lovehopeloveBTSforeverBTShope"`, and the list of strings could be `["love", "hope"]`. Your function should output the starting index location of any permutation of the words in the list. For this example, the permutations would be `"lovehope"` and `"hopelove"`, and the function would return `[0, 4]`.

- **`generate_fan_chant(fan_chant: str, chant_words: List[str]) -> List[int]`**
  - A function that finds all index positions where permutations of `chant_words` appear in the fan chant.
  - **Time Complexity:** `O(K * W * N)`, where `N` is the length of `fan_chant`, `K` is the number of elements in `chant_words`, and `W` is the length of the words in `chant_words`.
  - **Space Complexity:** `O(K)`, where `K` is the number of elements in the `chant_words` list.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `fan_chant: str` — A string representing the BTS fan chant.
    - `chant_words: List[str]` — A list of strings representing the words we want to find in the fan chant.
  - **Returns:** A list of integers containing the starting indices of any permutation of the words within the fan chant.
  - **All words in `chant_words` will be of the same length.**

#### Example 1  
```python
fan_chant = "lovehopeloveBTSforeverBTShope"
chant_words = ["love", "hope"]
output = generate_fan_chant(fan_chant, chant_words)
# output should be [0, 4]
```
**Explanation:**
The first occurrence of a permutation of `chant_words` starts at index `0`, corresponding to `"lovehope"`. The second occurrence starts at index `4`, corresponding to `"hopelove"`.

#### Example 2  
```python
fan_chant = "lovehopeBTS!loveBTS!foreverBTS!love"
chant_words = ["love", "BTS!"]
output = generate_fan_chant(fan_chant, chant_words)
# output should be [8, 12, 27]
```
**Explanation:**
- Index `8` corresponds to the start of the permutation `"BTS!love"`.
- Index `12` corresponds to `"loveBTS!"`.
- Index `27` corresponds to `"BTS!love"`.

#### Example 3  
```python
fan_chant = "lovehopeloveBTS!foreverBTS!hope"
chant_words = ["BTS!", "hope"]
output = generate_fan_chant(fan_chant, chant_words)
# output should be [23]
```
**Explanation:**
The only occurrence of a permutation of `chant_words` starts at index `23`, corresponding to `"BTS!hope"`.

### Note on HashTables

For this task, you're expected to utilize `HashTables`, treating them like Python dictionaries. However, specific methods are off-limits:

- **DO NOT use**: `_hash()`, `_insert()`, `_delete()`, `_get()`, and `_grow()`.
- Instead, use magic methods and treat your `HashTable` as if it were a Python dictionary.

### About Private Methods

While many programming languages strictly enforce private attributes and methods, Python adopts a convention-based approach. In Python, any method or attribute starting with an underscore (`_`) is considered "private," meaning it should not be accessed outside its class. However, Python does not technically enforce this privacy.

It is essential to follow this convention. Typically, unit tests should test functionality rather than the underlying implementation. In this problem, you should respect both aspects. Ensure you adhere to this guideline when crafting your solution.
